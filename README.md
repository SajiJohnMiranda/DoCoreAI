## 💡 How Does It Work?  

### **🔗 Step-by-Step Workflow:**
1️⃣ **User Query →** A user submits a question/query to your application.  
2️⃣ **DynamicCoreAI Enhances Prompt →** The system analyzes the query and generates an optimized prompt with the best intelligence parameters.     _Optional Parameters:_
    User role, domain, and output format are supported but optional

3️⃣ **Send to LLM →** The refined prompt is sent to your preferred LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.).  
4️⃣ **LLM Response →** The model returns a highly optimized answer.  
5️⃣ **Final Output →** Your application displays the AI’s enhanced response to the user.  

👉 **End Result?** More accurate, contextually rich, and intelligent AI responses that **feel human-like and insightful**.
